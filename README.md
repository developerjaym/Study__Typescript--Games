# Games
It started as a boring dice-based board game and has now become so much more. 

It is now TWO boring board games!

## The Basic Idea
I wanted to study TypeScript outside of any framework, so I decided to code a couple board games. After doing so, I realized they both had a lot in common, so I tried to extract all the shared code into reusable services. This worked nicely, so I then tried to add a menu page and a router. 

## Things of Interest
- It does dependency injection
- It does some other design patterns, like factory.
- It toggles stylesheets depending on the page that is currently active
- It has a router. Not a very good one, yet. It doesn't even allow child routes. But it is a router. Thanks ChatGPT for the assist here.
- It has the potential for environments.
- It is deployed [here](https://localstorage.tools/game/board/).

## Anyways
It is still a work in progress. I hope to add many more games and clean up the code more.
